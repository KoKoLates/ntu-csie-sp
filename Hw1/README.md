# HW1: Booking
The system is comprised of read servers and write servers. Both can access a file `bookingRecord` that records information about users’ bookings. When a server gets a request from a client, it will respond according to the file’s content. A read server tells the client how many items it has booked. A write server can modify the file to book more or less items.
